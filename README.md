# Covid-19-Image-Classification
Image classification of Chest X Rays in one of three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19
Dataset from COVID-19 Radiography Dataset on Kaggle
Using PyTorch to create and train a ResNet-18 model and apply it to a Chest X-Ray Radiography Dataset. I have accomplished by completing each task in the project:

Task 1: Introduction

Task 2: Importing Libraries

Task 3: Creating Custom Dataset

Task 4: Image Transformations

Task 5: Prepare DataLoader

Task 6: Data Visualization

Task 7: Creating the Model

Task 8: Training the Model

Task 9: Final Results
